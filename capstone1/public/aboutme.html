        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr />
        <p> My name is A.Kadir Ayyıldız i am a 20 years old IBS student in HFU Furtwangen among my programming and business studies i am also learning, practicing and working freelance in creative content creation market, video making to be more spesific. This is my hobby
            as well as GYM and Lego collection.
        </p>
        <p>With the fact that being creative is my super power, i've realized i've always being in love with creating things even when i was a kid. I've made my first comic book when i was 7, i've filmed my first stop motion Lego film when i was 9 and i've edited
            my first film/ youtube video when i was 12. With that being said i wanted to create more and more and more in any aspect of art in the life and only thing that i've never been able to create was creating a website or creating a game. Despite the
            fact that i've never had my own computer until my university starts, i was editing high quality videos for my clients just with my mother's phone when i was coming back from the school. With this limited, hard and exhausting but educative experience
            i was be able to create miracles with my first computer experience. I was so good that my former senior video editor co-workers were jealous in a good way for my skills and creativity. Now that i have a sufficient computer and
            i'm studying in my dream school in my dream country, there is nothing in my way to stop me from creating resonative games and websites.</p>
        <p>I'm grateful for everything especially the hard things that helped me to become i am who i am today. I'm looking forward to accomplish even more.</p>
